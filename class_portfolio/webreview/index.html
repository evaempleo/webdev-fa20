    <h1>The Web</h1>

<p> Sitting down and attempting to choose one number or symbol or letter to express how I feel about the web is like trying to choose a place to eat when you're not that hungry. It's hard. The web is so vast and there are so many pros and cons - actually that might be a good place to start - a pros and cons list?

</p>
<p> Pros
    <ul> 
        <li>Made it possible for people to keep working during the pandemic/go to school</li>
        <li>Connection</li>
        <li>Speed and general convenience</li>
        <li>Effective for advocacy</li>
        <li>Entertainment</li>
        <li>Information</li>
    </ul>

</p>

<p>
    Okay well obviously there is a good chance I would not be employed or enrolled in school without the internet. So that would put me at like a 100/10.

    I can communicate with friends and family or even people I've never met before whenever I want. 150/10. Social issues have come to light that otherwise may never have been in history books and there is endless access to entertainment and information. 200/10. 

    </p>


<p> Cons
    <ul>
        <li>Difficulties</li>
        <li>Dark web</li>
        <li>Bullying</li>
        <li>Hacking</li>
        <li>Lack of focus/Distractions</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Of course, the Web can be frustrating. Even though you can pretty much look up the answer to anything, the Web doesn't always know exactly what you're looking for. So counting backwards from my 200/10, I'd put that at a 190/10 because it doesn't hurt to keep looking. 

    Then theres issues like the dark web and bullying and hacking... I'd give that a minus everything because I cannot justify leaving points after thinking about the danger that arises. Then of course there is the decreased attention span but I feel like that's just collateral. 

</p>

<p> Rating: I guess a solid 0 </p>

<p> If I didn't analyze this so mathematically or overthink, I'd probably give the internet a 10/10 or at least a more positive rating because I cannot imagine my life without the Web.</p>
