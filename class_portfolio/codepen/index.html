    <h2> Just me fangirling over this Netflix show </h2>

    <div> 
        <h3> Schitt's Creek swept the Emmys this past week! </h3> 
        <p> It took me multiple tries to actually get into this show. </p>
        <p> I was so put out by the first episode but after getting through it and a few more episodes, I was hooked. </p>
        <p> And by the end of season 6... I was sobbing that it was over.</p>
        <h5> You really have to get to know the characters </h5>
        <h6> It deserved every Emmy it got </h6>
